# Instructions:

1. The two tasks are:
   - Implementing a dictionary using splay trees
   - Implementing a dynamic table(With and without structure hacking)

2. The given interfaces are what your implementations should adhere to. Do NOT change the interface.
3. The same interface should be used for both dynamic table implementations.
4. The given client file is NOT an actual test case on which you will be evaluated, it is given so that you are aware of how the functions are called.
5. Use the client file as a template to write your own test cases so that you can provide the required statistics in your document file.
